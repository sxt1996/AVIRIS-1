# AVIRIS-1
The data set was captured by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over San Diego. The original image includes 224 spectral channels in the wavelength range of 370 to 2510 nm. We reserved 189 bands in the experiments, leaving out the water absorption bands and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) bands. The full image of the urban scene contains 400×400 pixels and the spatial resolution is 3.5m. The AVIRIS-1 used in experiments is a sub-image with 100×100 pixels. 
# Objects to be Detected in AVIRIS-1
There are three airplanes to be detected occupying 22, 22, and 20 pixels respectively.
# AVIRIS-2
The data set was also originally obtained by AVIRIS, and consisted of 128×128 pixels selected from the entire scene. There are 189 bands remaining after the removal of the poor-quality bands and the spatial resolution is 3.5m. 
# Objects to be Detected in AVIRIS-2
In this sub-image, the three airplanes to be detected contain 34, 42, and 44 pixels respectively.
